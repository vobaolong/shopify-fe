# Migration Report

## Overview

This document outlines the migration work completed on the Shopify-FE e-commerce application, focusing on three major architectural upgrades:

1. Redux to Redux Toolkit
2. Fetch API to Axios
3. Integration of TanStack Query
4. Bootstrap to Ant Design (preserving class names)

## 1. Redux Migration

### Completed Tasks:

- Created a new Redux store using configureStore
- Created slices for all existing reducers:
  - accountSlice.js
  - userSlice.js
  - storeSlice.js
  - productSlice.js
  - sellerSlice.js
- Implemented automatic state immutability with Immer
- Updated action creators to use slice.actions
- Preserved backward compatibility for existing components

### Benefits:

- Reduced boilerplate code
- Simpler reducer logic with direct state mutations
- Improved typing support
- Better developer experience
- Simplified debugging

## 2. Fetch to Axios Migration

### Completed Tasks:

- Created a centralized axios client (axiosClient.js)
- Implemented request/response interceptors
- Added automatic token handling and refresh
- Converted ALL API functions to use axios (100% complete):
  - auth.js
  - product.js
  - order.js (with full support for all order, return and refund operations)
  - cart.js
  - address.js
  - brand.js
  - category.js
  - commission.js
  - follow.js
  - store.js
  - variant.js
  - review.js
  - notification.js
  - transaction.js
  - report.js
  - level.js
  - user.js
  - level.js
  - notification.js
  - report.js
  - review.js
  - transaction.js
  - user.js
  - variant.js
  - store.js

### Benefits:

- Consistent error handling
- Automatic request/response transformations
- Built-in request cancellation
- Simpler API with less boilerplate
- Improved request timeouts and retries

## 3. TanStack Query Integration

### Completed Tasks:

- Set up QueryClientProvider in App.jsx
- Created and enhanced custom hooks for data fetching patterns:
  - useProducts.js
  - useCart.js (refactored with mutation factory pattern)
  - useUser.js
  - useOrder.js (enhanced with full order management capabilities, refactored with mutation factory)
  - useReview.js (updated with proper mutation hooks, refactored with mutation factory)
  - useStore.js
  - useCategory.js
  - useBrand.js
  - useVariant.js
  - useNotification.js
  - useReport.js
  - useTransaction.js
  - useAddress.js
  - useQueryUtils.js (utility functions for TanStack Query cache management)
  - useInvalidate.js (utility for simpler query invalidation)
  - useMutationFactory.js (factory pattern for mutation hooks)
- Implemented query keys for effective caching
- Added mutation hooks with automatic query invalidation
- Enhanced caching strategies using query key prefixes
- Applied DRY principles with hook factories and utility functions

### Benefits:

- Automatic caching and refetching
- Background updates and stale-while-revalidate patterns
- Built-in loading and error states
- Pagination and infinite scrolling support
- Server state synchronization
- Prefetching capabilities

## 4. Ant Design Integration

### Completed Tasks:

- Integrated Ant Design components
- Maintained Bootstrap class names for backward compatibility
- Updated components with Ant Design:
  - ProductCard
  - CategoryCard
  - StoreCard
- Maintained existing styling while leveraging Ant Design capabilities
- Used Ant Design Skeleton components for better loading states

### Benefits:

- Modern, responsive components
- Better accessibility
- More comprehensive component library
- Better performance
- Consistent design system

## Latest Updates (May 14, 2025)

### Completed:

1. **Finalized Fetch to Axios Migration**

   - Verified and confirmed all API files (17 total) now use axios consistently
   - Standardized error handling across all API functions
   - Added proper Content-Type headers for file uploads
   - Used query parameters consistently across all endpoints

2. **Enhanced TanStack Query Implementation**

   - Expanded factory pattern approach with additional hooks
   - Created comprehensive example components showcasing the pattern
   - Updated documentation with detailed usage examples
   - Added better cache invalidation strategies across related queries

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated QUERY_GUIDE.md with comprehensive examples
   - Added detailed explanation of the mutation factory pattern
   - Documented best practices for query key structure

## Next Steps

1. Update unit tests to reflect the new architecture
2. Convert more UI components from Bootstrap to Ant Design
3. Add additional performance optimizations like query prefetching
4. Consider adding TypeScript for improved type safety
5. Implement end-to-end testing with Cypress
